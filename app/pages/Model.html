    <h3>Overview</h3>


    <p>In this section presents the results of our model. In the model dervation section we present how we came up with the model, the corresponding
    assumptions and equations. In the parameter estimation section we list the parameters used and how they were estimated. For a description of the
    implementation details, see the implementation section and for an overview of the biology, see the design section. </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <p>An important part in engineering is the simulation of systems in order to yield an insight of the expected behaviours before actual
    implementations are carried out. This process can be both resource and time saving as practical implementations are often expensive and tedious to
    carry out. The same principle can be applied in synthetic biology where biological constructs are tested in silica prior to wet lab
    implementations. By simulating the behaviours, it is possible in an early stage of the development to evaluate whether the construct will suffice
    it's intended application. This is especially important for complex systems where basic heuristics no longer can give neither sufficient
    predictions or mechanistic understandings of the underlying components. </p>

    <p>The purpose of this model is to study the time dynamics of a <i>lac</i> regulated AND-gate based on a tripartite association of green
    fluorescent proteins induced by salicylate and estrogen. The intentions are to study the dose-response behaviours with respect to <i>two</i>
    inputs. Interesting parameters are the dose-response sensitivities and the dose-response times as these play an important part in real life
    applications of biosensors. Additionally, it is interesting to study the underlying biochemical mechanics in order to establish an understanding
    of the behaviours. Also, would a biosensor of this kind be sufficient for the detection of two concurrently present molecules?</p>


    <h3>Dose-response analysis</h3>

    <h5>Detection limit</h5>
    <p>In this section we study we biosensors dose-response characteristics. <i>Figure 1</i> illustrates the dose-response landscape for the system.
    The surface was generated by letting the system evolve until steady state (5000 min) without any inducers, followed by the simultaneous addition
    of IPTG, salicylate and estrogen. A concentration of 1 mM IPTG was added and the salicylate and estrogen were varied  in the range 0-1000 nM and
    0-1000 nM for 40 steps respectively. The system was then further simulated until equilibrium (5000 min) and the steady state concentrations
    of the associated GFP were saved. From the figure, it can be seen that for low concentrations of pollutants (salicylate/estrogen), a low response
    is obtained. As the concentrations are increased, the corresponding response is increased until reaching a plateau were the response is saturated for
    increased concentrations of pollutants, giving the landscape the characteristic mountain look. This is reasonable as the amount of GFP expressed
    is limited by the amount of GFP1-9 and GFP10-ER-GFP11. For instance, adding more salicylate will eventually make all the <i>Psal</i>
    transcriptionally active and the addition of more will thus not increase the expression of GFP1-9. In a similar manner, if all GFP10-ER-GFP11 has
    been activated and associated with GFP1-9, the addition of estrogen will not cause more GFP10-ER-GFP11 to be expressed. Consequently, if either
    one of proteins are abscent, a complementation cannot occur and the response remains unchanged. </p>

        can be observed where the response reaches a plateau for high concentrations of salicylate and estrogen.</i>

    <p><i>Figure 2</i> shows the dose-response heat map for the system obtained by looking at the surface level of <i>figure 1</i> in the
    salicylate-estrogen plane. From the figure, the sensitivity with respect to salicylate and estrogen can be studied. It can be seen that no respose
    is generated for low concentrations of both inputs. In addition, in the abscence of either molecule, no output is generated regardless if the
    other exists in excess or not. This clearly illustrates the AND-behaviour and it can be seen that the detection limits are approximately 1 nM and
    100 nM for salicylate and estrogen respectively. Concentrations lower than those yield either no or a weak response relative to the maximal
    response. Clearly, this indicates a very sensitive system with respect to the inputs. However, since the detection limit of extracellular
    salicylate was 1 nM and since the model assumes free diffusion, this would correspond to roughly 1 nM intracellular salicylate which is roughly
    one molecule. This means that it would be possible yield a response based of one single molecule entering the cell. Clearly, this is an
    overestimate of sensitivity and to model this more accurately on a single cell level one would need to use discrete, stochastic methods. However,
    since we are considering a determinstic scheme interpreted as the average response over a large population, we make no assumption as to the
    homogenity of the salicylate distribution among the cells. That is, even though the concentration of salicylate in one cell is less than one
    nanomolar, this does not mean that the cell has a half molecule of salicylate in the cytoplasm, but rather that the average amount of molecules
    over the population is one half salicylate. Nevertheless, the model indicates that the sensor could be highly sensitive. </p>

        illustrates the detection region where the system is able to respond on salicylate and estrogen.</i>

    <h5><i>lac</i> regulation </h5>
    <p> With the use of <i>lac</i> inducible promoters, it is possible to have an on/off switch regulating the AND-gate. The dose-response landscape
    and heat map obtained without any IPTG inducer but otherwise same conditions as in <i>figure 1</i> and <i>figure 2</i> is shown in <i>figure 3</i>.
    A slight leak response can be observed which is because the <i>lac</i> repression does not inactivate the expression entirely. Since the repressing
    dynamics is modeled as a sequence of reversible reactions, there will always be a small amount of unbound operators allowing for transcription to
    occur. Nevertheless, when comparing the expression levels with the induced case in <i>figure 1</i> we see that the difference is at least four
    orders of magnitude, clearly indicating a working switch. </p>

        although there exist a slight leakage, the response is still at least four orders magnitude lower than in the IPTG induced case. </i>

    <h3>Time characteristics</h3>


    <h5>Response time analysis</h5>

    <p> Figure 4 illustrates four simulations showing the time evolution of the associated GFP, GFP1-9 and estrogen bound GFP10-ER-GFP11. The
    simulations were run as usual (see implementation section for details), using salicylate and estrogen concentrations in the range 1-100 nM and
    10-300 nM respectively. It can be seen that the time evolutions are smooth as the species converges to steady state concentrations and that no
    oscillations are present. There are thus no observed undershoots or overshoots as a response to salicylate and estrogen. The rise time for the
    associated GFP, defined as the time it takes to go from 10% to 90% of the steady state value was measured at approximately 650 min for all
    realisations. The settling time, defined as the time it takes to fall within 2% of the steady state concentration was measured at roughly 1200 min
    for all simulations. </p>

    When using the construct for practical applications, it would be of great interest of reducing the rise time to allow for a rapid detection of solutes...

    <br><br>
    The long response times can be traced back to the tripartite split GFP association rate constant which was estimated at a value of 1.8e-5 nm/min.
    Clearly, this makes the biosensor inherently slow unless optimizations at the primary structure of the protein is made to facilitate the
    association. As such, as indicated by the sensitivity analysis in figure …. Changing the promoter strength … does not improve the response times
    significantly. </p>

    <h5>Gene regulation</h5>

    <p> The dynamics of the <i>lac</i> operators prior to the addition of IPTG, salicylate and estrogen is shown in <i>figure 5</i>. The upper part of
    the figure shows the repression of the <i>lac</i> operators regulating the expression of NahR and GFP10-ER-GFP11. It can be seen that all
    operators are repressed within a couple of minutes. However, within this timeframe both proteins are transcribed until completely repressed. This
    is noted in the lower part of the figure where expressed NahR binds to the <i>Psal</i> promoter, inverting the ratio between the protein bound
    promoter <i>NPsal</i> and <i>Psal</i>. However, as the operators are repressed, the expression of NahR alters and the equilibrium is displaced
    back to <i>Psal</i> as the NahR is decomposed. <b>Slutsats?</b></p>

    <figure style="text-align:center">

        <i>Figure 5:</i>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The dynamics of the <i>lac</i> operators and the <i>Psal</i> promoter after the addition of IPTG, salicylate and estrogen is shown in <i>figure
    6</i>. Here, 100 nM and 300 nM of salicylate and estrogen was used and the IPTG concentration was set at 1 mM. In the upper part of the figure, it
    can be seen that all operators are repressed at time zero, completely inhibiting the transcription of NahR and GP10-ER-GFP11. After the addition
    of IPTG, the operators are derepressed which consquently increases the transcription rates. It can be seen that not all repressors are inhibited
    at steady state, indicating that higher expression levels can be achieved by the addition of more IPTG. However, we chose to limit the
    extracellular concentration to 1 mM to keep the simulation within realistic boundaries set by wet-lab working conditions [1]. In addition, it is
    also worth noting that we did have some issues with numerical instability for higher concentrations of IPTG. This can be traced to the shock
    effect which occurs when a high concentration of IPTG is added momentaneously at time zero. However, it was observed that this problem could be
    circumvented by gradually increasing the concentration over a short time span instead of adding everything simultaneously.</p>


    <p> The dynamics of the <i>Psal</i> promoter is illustrated in the lower part of the figure. At time zero, only <i>Psal</i> is present due to the
    abscence of NahR and salicylate. As time progresses, NahR is expressed, forming the intermediate NahR bound promoter denoted as NPsal. This is
    followed by salicylate simultaneously diffusing over the cell membrane and binding to NPsal. What is observed is then the <i>Psal</i> promoter
    slowly decreasing in concentration while <i>NPsal</i> is formed, followed by a lagged increase of the active promoter <i>SNPsal</i>. It can be
    seen that all <i>Psal</i> is converted into the active form <i>SNPsal</i> within the range of approximately 200 min. This indicates that the
    expression of GFP1-9 does not reach the maximal rate until 200 min after induction.</p>
