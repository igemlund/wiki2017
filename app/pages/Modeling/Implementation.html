  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Numerical reliability and repdroducibility is a crucial part of research. Thus, in this section we provide the implementation details of how we
  constructed and solved the model.  </p>

  <h3>Programming environment</h3>

  <p> The entire system was implemented in MATLAB (2017a, The Mathworks Inc.) using the SimBiology<super>&copy;</super> app which provides a block diagram environment for a
  model-based design implementation of biochemical networks. By using drag and drop features, species and reactions are placed in an editor and
  connected to yield a model based representation of the system. The representation then generates code which constitutes to the differential
  equations (or transitions in the case of stochastic modeling) which can be used for simulations. The SimBiology app thus  provides an efficient way
  to build biochemical network models and automatically generate differential equations without the need to manually balance
  reaction fluxes which otherwise can be highly error prone.</p>

  <p><i>Figure 1</i> illustrates our model implemented in the graphical user interface. The diagram consists of  blue boxes, yellow nodes and arrows
  interconnecting the components. The boxes represent the interacting species and the nodes the corresponding reactions. Lines pointing from a specie
  into a node represents a reactant and lines pointing out from a node to a specie represents a product. Dashed lines indicate that the reactant is not
  consumed under the reaction.</p>

  <p>The illustrated system can be subdivided into five parts. The first part (a) illustrates the <i>lacI</i> dynamics which expresses the <i>lac</i>
  repressor. In (b), the IPTG induction of the repressed genes represented by their operons ON and OE is shown. These operons regulate the epression
  of GFP1-9 and GFP10-ER-GFP11 respectively. The NahR pathway is marked by (c) and shows the binding to NahR to the <i>Psal</i> promoter followed by
  the subsequent transcriptional activation by salicylate to yield GFP1-9. In (d), GFP10-ER-GFP11 is translated and activates by the addition of
  estrogen. In the final part (e), the GFP association occurs, yielding a fully restored chromophore.</p>

  of the SimBiology&copy; implementation of our system. The networks can be considered as five parts (a)-(e) governing the dynamics of separate
  components. Those include the expression of the <i>lac</i> repressor, <i>lac</i> regulation, NahR and GFP10-ER-GFP11 pathway and final GFP
  association respectively.</i> </figcaption> </figure>

  <h3>Experimental setup</h5>  <p> The simulation was run without any inducer or estrogen/salicylate until equilibrium. These values were then
  recorded and chosen as initial concentrations for the subsequent simulations. This was done to simulate the cellular activity as realistically as
  possible, as the protein concentrations of the repressor should be nonzero when the inducers are added. The initla concentration was the same for
  each algorithm as no simulation parameters were changed

  </p>

  <h3>Implementation details</h3>

  <h5>Choice of ODE solver</h5>


  <p> Since we had parameters differencing with several orders of magnitude, numerical stiffness was expected and a stiff ordinary differential
  equation (ODE) solver had to be used. For this we choose MATLABs solver <i>ODE23t</i> (MATLAB 2017a, The Mathworks Inc.) as it was found to have the
  fastest performance on our system among the other solvers in the MATLAB ecosystem. This solver is commonly used to solve moderately stiff ODEs and
  uses a variant of the classical trapezoidal rule. </p>

  <h5>Choice of optimization algorithm</h5>

  <p> For doing parameter estimation, several optimization algorithms were tried such as <i>FMINSEARCH</i> (MATLAB 2017a, The Matworks Inc.),
  <i>LSQNONLIN</i> (MATLAB 2017a, The Matworks Inc.) and <i>PARTICLESWARM</i> (MATLAB 2017a, The Matworks Inc.). The function <i>LSQNONLIN</i> was
  chosen as it seemed to perform best. The solver is commonly used to solve nonlinear least square problems and uses the Levenberg-Marquart algorithm.
  All optimizations were run using standard configurations. </p>

  <h5>Simulation parameters</h5>

  <p> To ensure numerically reliable solutions, all simulations were carried out using an absolute error tolerance of 10<sup>-7</sup> and a relative
  error tolerance of 10<sup>-7</sup> and carefully inspected to keep off spurious solution. In addition, several after each succelful run, the
  solution was tested against other ODE solvers such as <i>ODE15s</i> (MATLAB 2017a, The Mathworks Inc.) to ensure a reliability. </p>
