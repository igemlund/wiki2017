      The iGEM Goes Green campaign was raised by the iGEM Team TU Dresden 2017 in order to raise awareness of the impact our actions have on our planet. The campaign is about to pay special attention to how to carry out sustainable lab work and find ways to compensate for our greenhouse gas emissions from the entire project. We really like their initiative and decided to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some of the efforts we made as a team this first year towards a sustainable participation in the competition:
    </p>

    <h3>In the lab</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We have informed that the freezer needs a defrost and disposed samples in the freezer that we no longer needed.</li>
      <li>We have turned off the lights and electrical devices when not in use.</li>
      <li>We have been careful to always keep the sash of our fume hoods as closed as possible.</li>
      <li>We tried to always run the autoclave enough filled.</li>
      <li>We have reduced the scale of experiments and prepared for the amount needed.</li>
      <li>We have purchased the pipette tips in bulk and refilled the old tip boxes.</li>
      <li>We have avoided as much as possible the use of hazardous chemicals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Others</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We have used the phrase “Think before you print” and all our protocols and agendas have been online.</li>
      <li>Our computers have been kept at energy saving mode when not in use.</li>
      <li>Everyone in the team has used a bike as their main transport vehicle.</li>
      <li>Whenever the team has needed to transport long distances, public transportation has been chosen.</li>
      <li>We have practiced our Skype communication skills with other teams.</li>
      <li>We have avoided to send papers by post when it has been possible to e-mail.</li>
      <li>We have when possible reduced transport ways when ordering lab material.</li>
      <li>Our hopes are that the next year’s iGEM team will arrange a green Nordic iGEM Conference 2018. We will recommend it to them.</li>
      <li>We paid attention and chose a sustainable bank from the top three in the <a href="http://fairfinanceguide.se" target="_blank">fair finance guide list</a>.</li>
      <li>Through our project we have chosen to raise awareness about the plastic issue.</li>
    </ul>
