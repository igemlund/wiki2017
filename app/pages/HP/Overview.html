        <p>As science and technology keep evolving through tireless probing of the world around us by experimentalists and theoreticians alike, presented analysis of the state and underpinnings of the universe and our place in it is gradually becoming more complex and, consequently, less accessible to the general public. However, a considerable amount of contemporary research has been focused on the environmental and social impact of the post-industrialized society. These findings detail a worrisome outlook with cause for major concern, mapping severe detrimental effects due to hyperactive depletion of our natural resources and mindless overconsumption [1] [2] [3]. It is therefore imperative that good communication strategies are developed, and implemented by scientists to convey their conclusions to the general public in a comprehensible manner. Halting the current unsustainable attitude toward consumption can only be achieved through world-wide cooperative engagement of people and businesses at every level of society. For this reason, we chose to focus on initiating dialogues with the general public as well as private and public actors to discuss how best to combat the issue of microplastics and what role synthetic biology might come to have in society.</p>

          <h4>Discussions with stakeholders</h4>
          <p>In the initial stages of our project design, we reached out to experts and stakeholders to evaluate the best approach in utilizing synthetic biology to aid in the engagement against microplastics. In particular, we exchanged dialogues with water resource management professionals to get a clearer view of current strategies in water purification with regards to microplastic contamination. What we found was that only limited resources are spent on targeting microplastics directly and that there still prevails some skepticism as to their ubiquity and impact. To see how this fundamentally sculpted our project plan, see <a href="/Team:Lund/HP/Integrated">integrated practices</a>.</p>

          <h4>Market scan for IKEA</h4>
          <p>We approached the home furniture company IKEA to learn more about their strategies on working with plastic materials and preventing plastic pollution. Many of their products are manufactured using synthetic textiles that have shown to shed plastic particles in the process of machine washing and in the initial stages of production. IKEA was keenly aware of this issue and have begun evaluating different methods of decreasing their plastic emission. To aid them in their efforts, we were given the opportunity to conduct a market analysis on existing technologies that IKEA could implement in their product development. In addition, we established a channel of communication between IKEA and multiple businesses working with developing joint strategies for microplastic prevention.

          <h4>Schools, public lectures and media</h4>
          <p>To ensure an environmentally sustainable future, every member of society needs to be inspired to take on an ecoconscious mindset as societal change only occurs as a function of shared conviction and passion. As we wanted to reach the widest audience possible to share our message about the importance of maintaining an eco-friendly lifestyle, in particular to discuss the consequences of careless consumption of plastics, we contacted multiple schools hosting pupils at different educational stages, set out to construct a series of public lectures and contacted media organizations all over Sweden to aid in our outreach.

          <h4>Analysis of <em>good </em>language in synthetic biology</h4>
          <p><em>Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt. - Wittgenstein</em></p>
          <p>Proper use of language is the essence of successful communication. It is of little matter how profoundly a topic is understood if it cannot be conveyed in a comprehensible manner. To tackle this, scientists in synthetic biology camouflages the intrinsic complexity of the biological systems they choose to work with through the use of mechanistic metaphors and adaptation of terminology utilized in classic engineering disciplines. While this is perhaps successful in providing the <em>intended</em> or <em>wanted</em> system characteristics, it does not necessarily illustrate the intrinsic stochasticity of the systems at hand. Furthermore, it carries certain ontological and ethical implications that must be considered. We explored the topic of good language in synthetic biology with the intention of creating a concise guide for future iGEM teams to use, see <em>What are we actually implying? [LINK]</em> </p>
