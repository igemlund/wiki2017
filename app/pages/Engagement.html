<h1>Education and Public Engagement</h1>
<h3>Best Education and Public Engagement Special Prize</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, we have seen teams produce some truly outstanding work in the areas of education and public engagement. Innovative educational tools and public engagement activities have the ability to discuss the science behind synthetic biology, spark new scientific curiosity and establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology from voices/views outside the lab.
