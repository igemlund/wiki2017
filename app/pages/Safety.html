          <p>We have been working with antibiotic resistant bacteria, that were resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol respectively. In order to minimize the risks while working with these bacteria we have followed the guidelines of WHO Laboratory biosafety manual (3d edition) as well as the guidelines of Lund University concerning lab safety.</p>
          <p>Our project did not include practically testing the device outside of the laboratory. All laborations were performed under safety restrictions such as, lab coats which were not allowed to be brought outside the lab, clean spill directly and spray with ethanol,  to decrease the possibility of transferring the bacteria outside the lab. Due to our cautious actions and restriction of the bacteria to the laborative working area, we did not include a kill-switch device, or similar, to our bacteria.</p>

          <p>Many would call it common sense when you start to discuss the “do’s and dont’s” in laboratory practice. Then again you will probably be surprised that many of the general questions that are supposed to be “obvious” actually have many different answers. Is it okay to <em>Mouth pipette</em>? Are you allowed to drink your morning coffee in the lab if it is not classified as a biohazardous?  If the answers to these questions are diverse you can imagine the problems that could occur in the lab if you are working with chemicals and you are not well prepared and do not know the established rules for the lab. It is not only the research which could be affected from poorly performed procedures but also your personal safety is in the risk zone.</p>

          <h4>Good Laboratory Practice</h4>
          <p>There are many actions which should be take in consideration to prevent this from happening. One important part can found in the principles of <em>Good Laboratory Practice </em>(GLP). The principles were put together from 29 industrialized countries in the purpose of creating a safe working practice but also to protect the consumers from research misconduct. The principles consist of information about what should be present in the facility in terms of educated staff, how a project should be constructed and how the results should be presented and information stored. This might not sound relevant since we are not constructing a larger project equivalent to a PhD or similar study where they need a study director and a principal investigator and strict rules how to write a report. However, we are also in need of knowing how to construct a proper study plan and risk assessment to decrease the risk of possible accidents. We are also in need of educated personnel which we could turn to in need of assistance. Hence, the GLP principles were reviewed and taken in consideration when constructing our project.</p>

          <h4>Before entering the laboratory</h4>
          <p>Before we started with the laboratory work we had thoroughly made a project plan, a risk assessment for each procedure and chemical that were to be used during the practice <strong><em>(full detail for each protocol and risk assessment can be found here…?)</em></strong>. When we first entered the laboratory we were given a careful presentation of the working place, how to properly dress, how to work in a bench, where to store the chemicals, and of course were to find all necessary safety equipment (fire extinguisher, eye and body shower, which number to call etc.) if there would be an accident. During the discussion afterwards we got answers to all our questions which we had prepared or come up with during the presentation (no you are not allowed to mouth pipette or drink coffee in the laboratory).</p>

          <h4>In the laboratory</h4>
          <p>It is good to be confident in your work and different procedures to create good results, however it is also easy to make mistakes. To decrease the risk of mistakes for both our results but most of all for our safety, we always followed a carefully made protocol where the procedures were described thoroughly step by step. We also had a risk assessment for each chemical in the procedure where the hazardous properties (if there were any) were clearly stated and followed with instructions how to take actions if unpredicted accidents would occur. We also wore lab coats and eye protection at all times in the lab as well as gloves when appropriate.</p>
