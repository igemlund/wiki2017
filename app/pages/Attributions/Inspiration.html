        <h3>Inspiration</h3>

        <p>The iGEM competition promotes a comprehensive project covering many of the facets that a working scientist has to be aware of while designing, conducting and presenting their research. However, as this was the first foray into real scientific work for the most of us, we felt the need to look outwards and talk to various professional for inspiration and motivation to ensure that we not only conduct ourselves appropriately as scientists but also get the most out of the iGEM experience. We want to thank everyone that offered their insight into the different aspects of the competition.</p>
        <p>For collaborations related to the 2017 iGEM competition, see <a href="/Team:Lund/Collaborations">collaborations</a>.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Gustaf Edman, Chalmers University alumni</dt>
          <dd>For invaluable advice on how to approach the iGEM competition as a new team. Mr. Edman was gracious enough to take time out of his very busy schedule to discuss the competition and all its various angle at length on multiple occasions, ranging from suggestions regarding the logistics of acquiring genetic material to potential challenges in the wet-lab.</dd>

          <dt>Olle Bergman, rhetorician and Lund University alumni</dt>
          <dd>For excellent suggestions on how to appropriately present research and how to convey it to the general public in an efficient and engaging manner. Mr. Bergmanâ€™s positivity, wit and jovial manner served as an endless source of motivation, entertainment and inspiration.</dd>

          <dt>Video conferences, various iGEM teams</dt>
          <dd>During the passing year, we exchanged numerous video conferences with teams from all over the world discussing various facts of the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. Each and every one of the dialogues left us with some advice or suggestion that would prove to play a role in the molding of some aspects of our project. Thus, we would be remiss if we did not mention their impact and thank them accordingly.</dd>
