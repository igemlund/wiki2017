    <h3>Overview</h3>


    <p>In this section presents the results of our model. In the model dervation section we present how we came up with the model, the corresponding
    assumptions and equations. In the parameter estimation section we list the parameters used and in the implementation section we explain how we
    implemented the system. For an overview of the biology, see the design section. </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <p>An important part in engineering is the simulation of systems in order to yield an insight of the expected behaviours before actual
    implementations are carried out. This process can be both resource and time saving as practical implementations are often expensive and tedious to
    carry out. The same principle can be applied in synthetic biology where biological constructs are tested <i>in silica</i> prior to wet lab
    implementations. By simulating the behaviours, it is possible in an early stage of the development to evaluate whether the construct will suffice
    it's intended application. This is especially important for complex systems where basic heuristics no longer can give neither sufficient
    predictions or mechanistic understandings of the underlying components. </p>

    <p>The purpose of this model is to study the time dynamics of a <i>lac</i> regulated AND-gate based on a tripartite association of green
    fluorescent proteins induced by salicylate and estrogen. The intentions are to study the dose-response behaviours with respect to <i>two</i>
    inputs. Interesting parameters are the dose-response sensitivities and the dose-response times as these play an important part in real life
    applications of biosensors. Additionally, it is interesting to study the underlying biochemical mechanics in order to establish an understanding
    of the behaviours. However, in the end, the main question is: would a biosensor of this kind be sufficient for the detection of two concurrently
    present molecules.</p>


    <h3>Dose-response analysis</h3>

    <p>In this section we study we biosensors dose-response characteristics. <i>Figure 1</i> illustrates the dose-response landscape for the system.
    The surface was generated by letting the system evolve until steady state (5000 min) without any inducers, followed by the simultaneous addition
    of IPTG, salicylate and estrogen. A concentration of 1 mM IPTG was added and the salicylate and estrogen were varied  in the range 0-1000 nM and
    0-300 nM for 40 and 20 steps respectively. The system was then further simulated until equilibrium (5000 min) and the steady state concentrations
    of the associated GFP were saved. From the figure, it can be seen that for low concentrations of pollutants (salicylate/estrogen), a low response
    is obtained. As the concentrations are increased, the corresponding response is increased until reaching a plateau were the response is saturated for
    increased concentrations of pollutants, giving the landscape the characteristic mountain look. This is reasonable as the amount of GFP expressed
    is limited by the amount of GFP1-9 and GFP10-ER-GFP11. For instance, adding more salicylate will eventually make all the <i>Psal</i>
    transcriptionally active and the addition of more will thus not increase the expression of GFP1-9. In a similar manner, if all GFP10-ER-GFP11 has
    been activated and associated with GFP1-9, the addition of estrogen will not cause more GFP10-ER-GFP11 to be expressed. Consequently, if either
    one of proteins are abscent, a complementation cannot occur and the response remains unchanged. </p>

    to the direct irreversible kinetics employed in the model where the associated GFP cannot dissociate back into the respective subparts.
